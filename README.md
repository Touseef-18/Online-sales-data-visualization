Sales data analysis using Power BI involves transforming raw sales data into actionable insights through an interactive dashboard. My project includes:

Data Integration – Import sales data from multiple sources (Excel, SQL, APIs).

Data Cleaning & Transformation – Use Power Query to clean and shape data for accurate analysis.

Key Metrics & KPIs – Track sales revenue, profit margins, customer trends, product performance, and regional sales.

Visualizations – Create interactive charts, graphs, and slicers to filter data dynamically.

DAX Calculations – Use Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create custom measures (e.g., Year-over-Year Growth, Total Sales).

Interactivity – Implement drill-through, tooltips, and filters for an intuitive user experience.

Dashboard Deployment – Publish reports to Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.
